###### Innovation & Implementation

 - new technologies
 - try out tools
 - performance tests

###### Rules are simple:

 - Make things better;
 - Work with whomever you want;
 - Work from anywhere you like;
 - Present your work at the end.

The only requirement is to shortly present results at the end of the second day of Hackathon.
