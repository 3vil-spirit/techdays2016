During Hacking Lab everyone will walk through the phases of an attack until successfully pwning various systems and services. There are plenty of attack scenarios to play through and to complete scored objectives. Since the expected participants' skill and experience level is varying to a large degree, we cover a mix of *nix and Windows world and focus on explaining key concepts and on showing the real attack even to those who have never compiled or launched any exploits before.
If you are going to participate in this thread mostly they would like to get some information upfront - [https://goo.gl/gYj0ks](https://goo.gl/gYj0ks)

**Target audience:** System administrators, information security specialists and - managers and any other IT personnel that are not afraid of the shell or command prompt.

###### Contents of the training:

- Introduction - The attacker point of view, the threat landscape today, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat), penetration testing. Intro to the virtualized training environment.
- Kali Linux 2.0 - a penetration testing Linux distribution that is the central tool to this training. All hands-on activity takes place on this popular pentesting distro. Each participant will his own Kali Linux  machine with target network cloned in the training environment.
- Reconnaissance and information gathering - banner grabbing, fingerprinting, service mapping, port- & vulnerability scanning. How to find and assess vulnerabilities, find exploits and stage attacks.
- Remote exploitation - attacking various operating systems (both *nix & Windows) and common services (like FTP, SSH, HTTP/S, etc.,) remotely, compiling and running exploits and using ready-made tools.
- Privilege escalation - local (root) exploits, password cracking, fun with meterpreter and Armitage features, etc.,) 
 - Jumping the (fire)wall - client-side attacks, attack pivoting, pilfering, mimikatz, backdoors, data exfiltration. 
 
**The ideology of this training:** The main differences between hacking and penetration testing are the intent and (imposed) limitations. Therefore, the idea behind this training is to see practical information security from the attacker's point of view and to deliver first-hand experience or running attacks. Although this training is highly technical and extensively hands-on, all scenarios are built so that with the help of hints, everyone should be able to complete all exercises regardless of prior 1337 skills or experience level with the various operating system. All of this what's coming during the hacking lab can be summarized with the quote from Sun Tzu - "The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable." 
 
**Intended outcome:** The participants should form a good understanding of current attacker tool-set, attack types and methods. By experiencing the attacker mindset and point of view via hands-on exercises the participants should gain a higher appreciation for attack threats. Also, become more alert and better prepared for their own IT systems defence and security testing. 

**Training environment:** is essentially a mobile training lab that can be brought to the participants anywhere in the world as long as VPN connection via decent Internet connectivity is viable. Training activity takes place inside a special virtualization server. Every participant will have access to an individual Kali Linux  machine and targets in a separate subnet. **Don't forget to bring your own laptops!**
